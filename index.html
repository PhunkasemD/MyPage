    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The reason I want to study Full Stack Web Development is that I aim to comprehensively learn both Front-end and Back-end development, enabling me to independently build complete applications. This knowledge will provide me with the freedom to work autonomously and the opportunity to achieve a higher income.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My expectations for this course are to be able to develop fully functional applications, which will allow me to further enhance both my studies and my future career opportunities.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The weakness I need to improve regarding my programming skills is the ability to think through and design methods within the source code to ensure the program operates with maximum efficiency. The approach to improvement involves increasing my practice in algorithms and continuously seeking additional knowledge to transform this weakness into a strength.</p>
